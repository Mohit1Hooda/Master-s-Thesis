The integration of genomics into crop breeding has become a key strategy in the constantly
changing landscape of modern agriculture, which is characterized by an increasing demand for
increased crop productivity and resilience to environmental challenges [Varshney et al., 2005].
Wheat, boasting an expansive genome housing over 107,000 genes and more than 4 million genetic
markers, plays a pivotal global role in feeding over a third of the world’s
population[Mayer et al., 2014].

Genomic Selection (GS), which was first described by [Meuwissen et al., 2001], is a new
statistical method that might help genetic progress go faster [Heffner et al., 2010]. When
GS was first used to breed crop species in 2007, it showed a lot of promise by speeding up
the breeding cycle and making it easier to find better genotypes. [Bernardo and Yu, 2007].
Using the power of high-throughput marker technologies and the right statistical methods
[Peace et al., 2019], it chooses complex, quantitative traits based only on marker data.
In the meantime, recurrent selection Recurrent Selection (RS), which is used to improve traits
that are passed down quantitatively, gradually raises the frequency of favorable alleles while
keeping genetic diversity for future selections[Hallauer and Darrah, 1985].

This thesis is about using RGS to get short-term benefits in wheat. RGS is an extension of GS
that uses genomic information in each breeding cycle, making the breeding process better
by evaluating and recombining the best-selected individuals[Veenstra et al., 2020]. When
using this method of breeding, early evaluation of selection candidates along with genomic
prediction could greatly shorten the breeding cycle, speeding up genetic gain in the short
term[Baertschi et al., 2021].

The study employs multiple RGS strategies involving iterative cycles. In each cycle, inbred
lines are selected and crossed, and 10 replications of each plant are utilized. The process
continues through three cycles, culminating in the selection of DH lines from Cycle 3.
Despite the advantages of RGS, challenges persist, particularly the issue of diversity loss
[Dunckel et al., 2017]. In the context of wheat, the repeated use of superior genomes to
enhance yield performance poses a significant challenge [Goiffon et al., 2017], as GS led
to higher genetic diversity loss than phenotypic selection by shortening the breeding cycle
time[Li et al., 2022]. The dilemma lies in balancing the pursuit of improved yield with
the need to maintain a diverse genetic base for long-term crop resilience. This challenge
highlights the intricacies of implementing GS strategies in wheat breeding and emphasizes
the importance of addressing genetic diversity concerns for sustainable and effective crop
improvement. To achieve this, various selection criteria are employed to formulate diverse
strategies for RGS, optimizing different aspects of plant breeding. These various criteria,
which are in line with the Selection Strategy’s objectives and reflect a methodical and 
strategic approach to plant breeding, serve as the basis for the selection and crossing of 
populations in RGS.

The selection criteria used are: GEGV, which looks at how closely genotypes are related
[Lell et al., 2021], is used to choose the best candidates. RND serves as a baseline,
introducing unpredictability and genetic diversity through a purely random crossing scheme.
The Crossing Scheme CB80 mates the better half of the chosen fraction with the worse half.
This maximizes truncation selection for quantitative traits[Cockerham and Burrows, 1980].
The GDI strategically selects crosses with the greatest genetic distances, contributing to
enhanced genetic diversity[Foss et al., 1993]. MAX aims to accumulate favorable alleles by
assessing the best additive genetic effects from both parents across all loci on chromosomes
[Daetwyler et al., 2015]. MSD utilizes the Usefulness Criterion (UC) [Schnell and Utz, 1975]
to select crosses, achieving a balance between mean performance and genetic variance with
specified selection intensity[Osthushenrich et al., 2017]. EMBV estimates the anticipated
performance of the most superior gametes that a candidate contributes to the succeeding 
generation, provided they are selected[Müller et al., 2018]. Lastly, the UC-OCS enhances 
optimal cross-selection by considering within-family variance and linkage 
disequilibrium [Allier et al., 2019]. These criteria collectively contribute to the development
of sophisticated and tailored strategies for RGS in plant breeding. Various strategies have been
formed based on these selection criteria. These include the RND selection strategy, which
is also the reference strategy; each cycle starts with GEGV and then uses RND criteria consistently
throughout the cycle. In CB80-L, GDI-L, and MAX-L, most steps are the same as
RND. GEGV is used for inbred line selection, and CB80, GDI, and MAX criteria are used
for crossing inbred lines in Cycle 1. MSD-L and MAX-F employ MAX for crossing inbred
lines, and MAX and MSD for crossing Population 1, respectively. MSD-1 is like MAX-F but
includes MSD for selection and crossing in Cycle 2. MSD-2 is like MSD-1 but also applies
MSD criteria at Cycle 3. EMBV uses EMBV for crossing in Cycle 2 and Cycle 3. UC-OCS,
like MSD-1, uses UC-OCS for crossing at Cycle 2.

In order to use RGS,we use datasets of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) marker data,
genotypic and wheat performance data. The marker effects of these datasets were meticulously
calculated through the Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) model, which serves
as the genome prediction mechanism. Subsequently, a simulation was iteratively conducted
over 1000 repetitions using different selection criteria specified for each strategy to generate
SYN1, SYN2, SYN3, and DH lines containing yield performance as mean genomic value
and diversity as excess heterozygosity. The SelectionTools library in the R programming 
environment (http://www.uni-giessen.de/population-genetics) facilitated this intricate process.
To assess and compare the effectiveness of these strategies, they were graphically compared
with each other. Overall, the method uses a thorough and organized approach, combining
advanced statistical methods, computer programs, and a variety of selection criteria to give a
full picture of the short-term RGS landscape in wheat. The emphasis on detailed data preparation,
simulation design, and thorough evaluations ensures the robustness and reliability of
the study’s findings. The objectives of the present simulation study were to

1. suggest strategies for short-term RGS based on different selection criteria and crossing
schemes,
2. evaluate these strategies in terms of selection gain and diversity reduction in the resulting
DH lines in wheat, and
3. compare them to the established standard method.
